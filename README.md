# javascript-externs-generator
Currently a WIP.

Based heavily on https://github.com/wiseman/closure-externs-generator

## TODO
* Clean up extern code
* Hook up UI events (loading, success, failure, etc.)
* Test on other libraries (currently only tested with pixi.js)
* Release to public (Reddit, Google groups)
